On start, the application should fetch the list of posts and display them in a list. Each item of the list should contain basic fields as title, body etc. When a user clicks on a list item app should present a detail view. Detail view should contain data from another endpoint including user data, comments and photo grid view (just show first 9-12 images from /photos), all this ​should be in same scrollable view​​.
